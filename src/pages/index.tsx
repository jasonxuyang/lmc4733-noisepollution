        Noise is often overlooked when understanding the human impact on the environment. However, noise pollution is a
        hazard for environmental and human health. Noise pollution disrupts wildlife, and it can lead to stress and
        disease in humans. Sound is measured in decibel units (dB), and long repeated exposure to sounds above 85 dB can
        cause hearing loss and other health complications.Â
